# F1-WDCs-Quiz
This is a simple program where you're asked about the F1 World Drivers' Championships by name and title number.  

It's on early stages of development, currently at 1.3. At the moment, it works on the terminal.

Remember! You're going to need to have Python installed in your system to properly run the program. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

When making a guess, try to answer with numbers (1990), not written characters (nine-teen ninety), because then the program will crash. I am yet to fix this, which will come in future updates. 

Infinite mode now works properly, feel free to try it.

This entire repository is a mess LMAO, I will try to fix this later on, for now I'll learn how GitHub works.
