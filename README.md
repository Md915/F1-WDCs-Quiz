# F1-WDCs-Quiz
This is a simple program where you're asked about the F1 World Drivers' Championships by name and title number. New options will come in new releases.  

It's version sits currently at 1.5. At the moment, it works on the terminal.

Remember! You're going to need to have Python installed in your system to properly run the program. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Support for mobile phones will come in the future, once I learn how to integrate my Python code into apps.

## IMPORTANT!
When making a guess, your answer must be written with the whole number year (1990), not written characters (nineteen ninety), because then the program won't accept it. You'll be asked to make your guess again.

Infinite mode now works properly, feel free to try it. New functions will come to it in the future (see more on ideas.txt).

PS. Slowly  but surely I'm learning to use GitHub, I am too scared to do it through Git (the cool way).
