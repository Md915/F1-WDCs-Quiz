# F1-WDCs-Quiz
This is a simple program where you're asked about the F1 World Drivers' Championships by name and title number.  

It's version sits currently at 1.4. At the moment, it works on the terminal.

Remember! You're going to need to have Python installed in your system to properly run the program. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

When making a guess, your answer must be written with the whole number year (1990), not written characters (nineteen ninety), because then the program won't accept it.  

Infinite mode now works properly, feel free to try it. Now functions will come to it in the future.

This entire repository is a mess LMAO, I will try to fix this later on, for now I'll learn how GitHub works.
