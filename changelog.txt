v-1.4. @ 09/12/2025 10:20:00 UTC +1 Madrid

- With the recent addition of Lando Norris as a Formula 1 World Champion, the program has been updated to include him on it. This means there's a chance you are now asked to guess him.


Currently working on a no-repetition mode (drivers won't repeat title after being guessed correctly or wrong (up to the user)).
Working on a mode to make the drivers not repeat themselves on any mode (user choice) if they've been already guessed, after 76 iterations, the program will ask them again.

v-1.3. @ 02/12/2025 09:50:00 UTC +1 Madrid

- Infinite mode has been finally implemented. You can choose to exit the program at any time (while making a guess) by typing 'exit' into the console, even in a fixed iteration mode.

v-1.2. @ 01/12/2025 09:35:00 UTC +1 Madrid

- Program has been made lighter, by importing just the required functions of each module.
- I've (successfully) managed to implement an iteration mode where the user chooses how many tries he's done.

Currently working on an infinite mode and a no-repetition mode (drivers won't repeat title after being guessed correctly or wrong (up to the user)).

v-1.1. @ 27/11/2025 09:39:00 UTC +1 Madrid

- Fixed bug where Alberto Ascari's titles where appearing in the wrong order, which brought confusion.

Plans:
- Adding an option where the user can select how many iterations (guesses) he wants to do.
- Adding an optional random iterations mode (from a selected range)
- Adding an infinite mode, where the user decides when to exit the program.
- Fixing bugs regarding inputs, to achieve a more user friendly experience.



v-1.0. @ 26/11/2025 10:23:00 UTC +1 Madrid

- Finally added every driver
- Fixed modules bug where they would not read properly.
