# This is the Formula 1 World Drivers Champions Quiz (1.5). 

My plans for thr program in the future:
- Working UI (long term).
- Option to also guess the WCC (Team) that won on that year (not necessairly the driver's team they drove for, which can also be an option.)
- I'll also add which F1 drivers championships you failed, (as well as constructors). 
- Instead of being asked the driver's title by name and number, asking directly the year (the user can decide which one to go for). 
- I'll also make them not repeat after being guessed (user choice).
- The user can choose to be asked a series of combinations, including the driver who won on X year with Y chassis, the chassis that won that year (or viceversa), the constructor who won on X year or given X year the constructor who won, and all possible combinations I can think of.
